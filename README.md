RGB_Fader
=========

This is a project that I intend to use for controlling an RGB high power LED. The purpose of this is to produce a set of RGB colors that represent a smooth transition for the human eye.
The author of the original code is  Marco Colli and it was found in this post: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=102040.0
